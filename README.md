Mine is the offline concept, which I didn't know there was a online concept as well called the ARC AGI.<br>

I have a basic white board concept I don't know if I will get it completed on time due to a few unforseen issues with hardware that took longer to configure than before. I look at several data structures and started this concept which may modify itself in a more complex way as I start to work with these different constructs to do the puzzles.
